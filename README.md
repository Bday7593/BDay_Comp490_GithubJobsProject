Project 1: Github Jobs API


The readme should have:
    a.) Any install and run directions I need beyond the basics.
        -only basic installation should be required to run.
    b.) A brief description of what your project does.
        - This project pulls the API data from the website: https://jobs.github.com/positions.json?page=1
            and stores the .json dictionaries from the website into a list. The list is tested to see
            that it has stores the proper amount of dictionaries and the list is also written onto a text
            document. The text document is opened and read to be tested against an existing company name
            ensuring the correct data was written into the text document.  
    c.) A brief description of what is missing from the project (if anything)
        - No missing material.
